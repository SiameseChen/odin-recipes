        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is based on the Thai version of iced green tea.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Thai Green Tea Mix</li>
            <li>Hot Water</li>
            <li>Matcha Tea Powder</li>
            <li>Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
            <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
            <li>Milk Foam</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew the Thai Green Tea by adding 2 tablespoons of Thai Green Milk Tea Mix to a filter sock and pouring through 1/2 cup of boiling water collecting the tea in a measuring jug (so you can see how much water you are adding).

                Repeat the process of pouring the tea through the filter sock another three times to extract as much taste as possible. You will need a second container to make this easy, passing the tea through the tea strainer sock from one container to the other.
                
                After the four pass-throughs, rest the tea straining sock still containing the tea in the hot tea to allow it to steep for a few minutes while you make the latte.</li>
            <li>Mix together 1 oz / 30ml of sweetened condensed milk (the thick one) with 1 oz / 30ml of evaporated milk. We use Carnation Brand but you can use any other you like.
                Stir to thoroughly mix. This little measuring glass is invaluable for making drinks and measuring small liquid amounts I find.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of matcha powder to the slightly cooled tea and mix thoroughly. It mixes more easily in the warm tea than afterward when everything is colder but it is not critical.</li>
            <li>If you want to add the froth to the top, and we suggest you do, then get some full-fat milk and use a frother to froth it up. You can either use a manual frother or an electric one.

                There are a couple of reasons for adding froth. First, it looks so much nicer and you can dust with matcha or drizzle on a syrupy topping which just looks so much nicer and more professional. Secondly, it changes the texture as you drink it, making for a smoother and creamier feel to adding to the senses you will be enjoying your drink with – the gorgeous smell, the delicious taste, the feel of that silky smooth froth on your tongue and the look of a professionally made drink!

            </li>
            <li>Top up your cup with crushed ice and add the mixed green tea matcha latte.

                You should fill up within about half an inch from the top if you are adding froth.
                
                Finally, add the froth and dust with your preferred adornment – I like dusting with a little matcha green tea powder to add to the aroma but don’t go sniffing too hard or it will be up your nose. Not illegal but perhaps unpleasant!</li>
